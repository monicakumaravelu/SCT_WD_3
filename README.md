# Quiz Application
# Project Overview

The Quiz Application is a full-stack web-based quiz system developed as part of Task 3 during my Web Development Internship. The application allows users to select a quiz domain, answer multiple-choice questions, view results, and review their responses.

This project represents an improvement over my previous frontend-only projects by introducing a backend database layer, making the application more dynamic, scalable, and efficient.

# Features

- Clean and minimal beige-themed user interface

- User name input before starting the quiz

-Multiple quiz domains:

      - Java

      - C

      - Python

- Dynamic quiz questions loaded from database

- Progress indicator during the quiz

- Score calculation after quiz completion

- Review page displaying:

       - User-selected answers

- Correct answers

- Clear indication of correct and incorrect responses

- Option to retake the quiz

- Leaderboard support using stored results

# Technologies Used
- Frontend

- HTML

- CSS

- JavaScript

# Backend & Database

- MySQL

- JavaScript (for database connectivity & logic)

# Database Design

- The application uses three separate MySQL tables:

- Users Table

- Stores user name and quiz domain selection

- Questions Table

- Stores quiz questions and options for each domain

- Results Table

- Stores user scores

- Used to calculate leaderboard rankings

# Application Flow

- User enters their name on the home page

- User selects a quiz domain (Java / C / Python)

- Quiz begins with multiple-choice questions

- Progress bar updates as questions are answered

- Score is calculated after completion

- Results are stored in the database

- Review page displays detailed performance

- User can retake the quiz or return to results
- 
# Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of full-stack application flow

- Practical experience integrating frontend with MySQL

- Improved knowledge of database design and queries

- Better handling of user input and data validation

- Experience building review and result analysis pages

# Future Enhancements

- User authentication and login system

- Timed quizzes

- More quiz domains and question sets

- Advanced leaderboard with filters

- Admin panel to manage questions

# Conclusion

This Quiz Application helped me transition from frontend-only development to a full-stack approach, allowing me to understand how frontend, backend, and database layers interact in a real-world application. It strengthened my confidence in building dynamic and data-driven web applications.
